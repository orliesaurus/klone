Klone - a game idea with a demo in JS

#What is it
We wanted to test how far we could take HTML5 and javascript over a period of roughly 16hours spent coding and the rest sleeping eating and laughing. Yes this was made at a hackathon.

#Why
We believe there is a lot of space for turn-based social games, that means games that you can play with your friends by taking turns and seeing who has the firmer hand and has the artsy factor.

#How to contribute
Simply clone the repo or download the zip - run the index file and enjoy the experience. If you believe you could help us make the game better don't be afraid to push your changes. We'll review them and likely to merge!
